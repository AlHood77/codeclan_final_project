### Capybara Cafe. A cafe/restaurant booking app.



You have been tasked to create a booking system for a brand new restaurant. The restaurant needs a way to book and arrange tables for customers who are booking over the phone. This system is for the staff to use.


#### Technologies:

* Front End: JavaScript, HTML and CSS using React written in VSCode
* Additional node modules used include: React Calandar, React-Modal and Moment
* Back End: Java 8 and SQL based using Spring and H2 written in IntelliJ
* Spring Boot 2.3.1 dependencies used, “Spring Boot DevTools”, “Spring Web”, “Spring Data JPA” and “H2 Database”.




#### MVP:


* Allow a customer to book a table at the restaurant for a particular time and date
* Update a booking, for example if the customer wants to change a booking time
* Display a list of bookings for a given date
* Display a list of customers ordered by frequency of visits




#### Possible Extensions:


* Don't allow double bookings
* Add a customer's receipt to a booking so you can view their previous orders and how much they spent
* Calculate how much a customer has spent over a given period of time
* Give discounts to frequent customers



#### Running the site locally:


* From the server folder run CapybaraApplication.  This can be done in IntelliJ by right clicking the CapybaraApplication file and clicking run
* From the client folder do the following installations:  "npm i" and then "npm start"
* The app should now be available locally, most likely on http://localhost:3000/ with the back end data available on for example http://localhost:8080/customers
